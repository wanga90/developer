Here is a breakdown of the structure of the Pong Game app:

1. **index.html**: This is the main HTML file that creates the structure of the webpage. It includes a canvas for the game area, and two div elements for the player and AI paddles. 

   - *DOM Elements:* 
     - `id="gameArea"` for the canvas.
     - `id="playerPaddle"` for the player's paddle.
     - `id="aiPaddle"` for the AI's paddle.

2. **style.css**: This file contains the CSS styles for the canvas and paddles. It sets the canvas to a 400x400 black square and centers it in the page. The paddles are made 100px long and yellow, and the ball small and red.

3. **main.js**: This is the main JavaScript file that controls the functionality of the game. It includes functions to control the player's paddle following the mouse, the AI paddle following the ball, collision detection between the ball and the paddles, and scoring.

   - *Variables*: 
     - `playerPaddle` and `aiPaddle` objects that represent the player and AI paddles.
     - `ball` object represents the ball.
     - `score` object keeps track of the player's and AI's scores.
   - *Functions*: 
     - `startGame()`: Initializes the game state.
     - `updateGame()`: Updates the game state at every frame, including moving the paddles and ball and checking for collisions.
     - `drawGame()`: Renders the game state on the canvas.
     - `playerMove(event)`: Controls the player's paddle based on mouse movement.
     - `aiMove()`: Controls the AI paddle based on the ball's position.
     - `checkCollision()`: Checks for collisions between the ball and the paddles or the boundaries of the canvas.
     - `updateScore()`: Updates the score based on ball-paddle collisions.
     - `increaseBallSpeed()`: Increases the ball's speed every time it bounces off a paddle.

4. **ai.js**: This file contains a simple AI algorithm to control the movement of the AI paddle. It slowly moves the paddle toward the ball at every frame, with some probability of error.

   - *Variables*: 
     - `aiSpeed` determines the speed of the AI paddle.
     - `aiError` determines the probability of error in the AI's movement.
   - *Functions*: 
     - `aiDecision()`: Makes a decision on the direction to move the AI paddle based on the ball's position and the error factor.

All these files will be linked together in the `index.html` file. The JavaScript files are written in a manner that doesn't use the import/export keywords and only uses features supported by the Chrome browser to ensure compatibility. Each JavaScript function uses the DOM API to interact with the HTML elements based on their id names.
